Chapter 1. Data science big data worldBig data blanket term collection data sets large complex becomes difficult process using traditional data management techniques as, example, RDBMS (relational database management systems). widely adopted RDBMS long regarded one-size-fits-all solution, demands handling big data shown otherwise. Data science involves using methods analyze massive amounts data extract knowledge contains. think relationship big data data science like relationship crude oil oil refinery. Data science big data evolved statistics traditional data management considered distinct disciplines. characteristics big data often referred three Vs: Volume —How much data there? Variety —How diverse different types data? Velocity —At speed new data generated? Often characteristics complemented fourth V, veracity: accurate data? four properties make big data different data found traditional data management tools. Consequently, challenges bring felt almost every aspect: data capture, curation, storage, search, sharing, transfer, visualization. addition, big data calls specialized techniques extract insights. Data science evolutionary extension statistics capable dealing massive amounts data produced today. adds methods computer science repertoire statistics. research note Laney Kart, Emerging Role Data Scientist Art Data Science, authors sifted hundreds job descriptions data scientist, statistician, BI (Business Intelligence) analyst detect differences titles. main things set data scientist apart statistician ability work big data experience machine learning, computing, algorithm building. tools tend differ too, data scientist job descriptions frequently mentioning ability use Hadoop, Pig, Spark, R, Python, Java, among others. Don’t worry feel intimidated list; gradually introduced book, though we’ll focus Python. Python great language data science many data science libraries available, it’s widely supported specialized software. instance, almost every popular NoSQL database Python-specific API. features ability prototype quickly Python keeping acceptable performance, influence steadily growing data science world. amount data continues grow need leverage becomes important, every data scientist come across big data projects throughout career. 1.1. Benefits uses data science big data Data science big data used almost everywhere commercial noncommercial settings. number use cases vast, examples we’ll provide throughout book scratch surface possibilities. Commercial companies almost every industry use data science big data gain insights customers, processes, staff, completion, products. Many companies use data science offer customers better user experience, well cross-sell, up-sell, personalize offerings. good example Google AdSense, collects data internet users relevant commercial messages matched person browsing internet. MaxPoint (http://maxpoint.com/us) another example real-time personalized advertising. Human resource professionals use people analytics text mining screen candidates, monitor mood employees, study informal networks among coworkers. People analytics central theme book Moneyball: Art Winning Unfair Game. book (and movie) saw traditional scouting process American baseball random, replacing correlated signals changed everything. Relying statistics allowed hire right players pit opponents would biggest advantage. Financial institutions use data science predict stock markets, determine risk lending money, learn attract new clients services. time writing book, least 50% trades worldwide performed automatically machines based algorithms developed quants, data scientists work trading algorithms often called, help big data data science techniques. Governmental organizations also aware data’s value. Many governmental organizations rely internal data scientists discover valuable information, also share data public. use data gain insights build data-driven applications. Data.gov one example; it’s home US Government’s open data. data scientist governmental organization gets work diverse projects detecting fraud criminal activity optimizing project funding. well-known example provided Edward Snowden, leaked internal documents American National Security Agency British Government Communications Headquarters show clearly used data science big data monitor millions individuals. organizations collected 5 billion data records widespread applications Google Maps, Angry Birds, email, text messages, among many data sources. applied data science techniques distill information. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) also strangers using data. use raise money defend causes. World Wildlife Fund (WWF), instance, employs data scientists increase effectiveness fundraising efforts. Many data scientists devote part time helping NGOs, NGOs often lack resources collect data employ data scientists. DataKind one data scientist group devotes time benefit mankind. Universities use data science research also enhance study experience students. rise massive open online courses (MOOC) produces lot data, allows universities study type learning complement traditional classes. MOOCs invaluable asset want become data scientist big data professional, definitely look better-known ones: Coursera, Udacity, edX. big data data science landscape changes quickly, MOOCs allow stay date following courses top universities. aren’t acquainted yet, take time now; you’ll come love have. 1.2. Facets data data science big data you’ll come across many different types data, tends require different tools techniques. main categories data these: Structured Unstructured Natural language Machine-generated Graph-based Audio, video, images Streaming Let’s explore interesting data types. 1.2.1. Structured data Structured data data depends data model resides fixed field within record. such, it’s often easy store structured data tables within databases Excel files (figure 1.1). SQL, Structured Query Language, preferred way manage query data resides databases. may also come across structured data might give hard time storing traditional relational database. Hierarchical data family tree one example.The world isn’t made structured data, though; it’s imposed upon humans machines. often, data comes unstructured. 1.2.2. Unstructured data Unstructured data data isn’t easy fit data model content context-specific varying. One example unstructured data regular email (figure 1.2). Although email contains structured elements sender, title, body text, it’s challenge find number people written email complaint specific employee many ways exist refer person, example. thousands different languages dialects complicate this.A human-written email, shown figure 1.2, also perfect example natural language data. 1.2.3. Natural language Natural language special type unstructured data; it’s challenging process requires knowledge specific data science techniques linguistics. natural language processing community success entity recognition, topic recognition, summarization, text completion, sentiment analysis, models trained one domain don’t generalize well domains. Even state-of-the-art techniques aren’t able decipher meaning every piece text. shouldn’t surprise though: humans struggle natural language well. It’s ambiguous nature. concept meaning questionable here. two people listen conversation. get meaning? meaning words vary coming someone upset joyous. 1.2.4. Machine-generated data Machine-generated data information that’s automatically created computer, process, application, machine without human intervention. Machine-generated data becoming major data resource continue so. Wikibon forecast market value industrial Internet (a term coined Frost & Sullivan refer integration complex physical machinery networked sensors software) approximately $540 billion 2020. IDC (International Data Corporation) estimated 26 times connected things people 2020. network commonly referred internet things. analysis machine data relies highly scalable tools, due high volume speed. Examples machine data web server logs, call detail records, network event logs, telemetry (figure 1.3).The machine data shown figure 1.3 would fit nicely classic table-structured database. isn’t best approach highly interconnected “networked” data, relationships entities valuable role play. 1.2.5. Graph-based network data “Graph data” confusing term data shown graph. “Graph” case points mathematical graph theory. graph theory, graph mathematical structure model pair-wise relationships objects. Graph network data is, short, data focuses relationship adjacency objects. graph structures use nodes, edges, properties represent store graphical data. Graph-based data natural way represent social networks, structure allows calculate specific metrics influence person shortest path two people. Examples graph-based data found many social media websites (figure 1.4). instance, LinkedIn see know company. follower list Twitter another example graph-based data. power sophistication comes multiple, overlapping graphs nodes. example, imagine connecting edges show “friends” Facebook. Imagine another graph people connects business colleagues via LinkedIn. Imagine third graph based movie interests Netflix. Overlapping three different-looking graphs makes interesting questions possible.
